    There are 8 basic data types in JavaScript.<br/>

1.number for numbers of any kind: integer or floating-point, integers are limited by ±253.<br/>
1.bigint is for integer numbers of arbitrary length.<br/>
3.string for strings. A string may have zero or more characters, there’s no separate single-character type.<br/>
4.boolean for true/false.<br/>
5.null for unknown values – a standalone type that has a single value null.<br/>
6.undefined for unassigned values – a standalone type that has a single value undefined.<br/>
7.object for more complex data structures.<br/>
8.symbol for unique identifiers.<br/>

The typeof operator allows us to see which type is stored in a variable.<br/>

Two forms: typeof x or typeof(x).<br/>
Returns a string with the name of the type, like "string".<br/>
For null returns "object" – this is an error in the language, it’s not actually an object.<br/>
The number type represents both integer and floating point numbers.<br/>
<p>

There are many operations for numbers, e.g. multiplication *, division /, addition +, subtraction -, and so on.<br/>

Besides regular numbers, there are so-called “special numeric values” which also belong to this data type:<br/>

let n = 123;<br/>
document.write("int",n)<br/>
n = 12.345;<br/>
document.write("float",n)<br/>

In JavaScript, the “number” type cannot represent integer values larger than (253-1) (that’s 9007199254740991), or less than -<br/>(-253-1) for negatives. It’s a technical limitation caused by their internal representation.<br/>

For most purposes that’s quite enough, but sometimes we need really big numbers, e.g. for cryptography or microsecond-precision timestamps.<br/>

BigInt type was recently added to the language to represent integers of arbitrary length.<br/>

A BigInt value is created by appending n to the end of an integer:*/<br/>
const bigInt = 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n;<br/>
document.write("bigint=",bigInt)<br/>

A string in JavaScript must be surrounded by quotes.<br/>
let str = "Hello";<br/>
document.write(str)<br/>
let str2 = 'Single quotes are ok too';<br/>
document.write(str2)<br/>
let phrase = `can embed another ${str}`;<br/>


--The boolean type has only two values: true and false.<br/>

This type is commonly used to store yes/no values: true means “yes, correct”, and false means “no, incorrect”.*/<br/>
var a=2,b=3;<br/>
c=a>b;<br/>
document.write("a=2"," ","b=3",c)<br/>

The special null value does not belong to any of the types described above.<br/>

It forms a separate type of its own which contains only the null value:*/<br/>
let age = null;<br/>
document.write(age);<br/>

The special value undefined also stands apart. It makes a type of its own, just like null.<br/>

The meaning of undefined is “value is not assigned”.<br/>

If a variable is declared, but not assigned, then its value is undefined:<br/>
let weight = 100;<br/>

 change the value to undefined<br/>
weight = undefined;<br/>

alert(weight);  "undefined"<br/>
